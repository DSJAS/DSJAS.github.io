# DSJAS - *Dave Smith Johnson & Son*

**Welcome to DSJAS family bank! Keeping your money somewhat safe since 2005!**

DSJAS is a simple PHP tool designed for "scambaiting". The site is designed to mimic the behavior and feel of a real banking site in order to fool scammers attempting to infiltrate online banking. The site does not handle real money and is therefore ideal for tricking scammers.

The site is highly customizable, with full support for plugins, themes and other trickery. Seemingly large-scale things such as the name and branding of the site can be changed with the click of a button.

In addition to all that, it's totally free and open source. More specifically, being licensed under the MIT licence.

## Requirements

> If you don't have experience with web technology and don't want to configure your own webserver and database, an all-in-one in package such as XAMP or MAMP will do this for you. Both of these packages are free for download.

### You must have installed

1. The Apache webserver. DSJAS does not support other webservers.
1. A MySQL database server. DSJAS stores information in a database. You should set one up before installing.
1. The PHP language and appropriate Apache plugin. The site is written in PHP, so it is naturally required. A version greater than 7.1 is recommended.
1. A web browser. The site relies on a web installer to configure itself. So, even if you don't want to view the site yourself, you need a browser.

### You may wish to have installed

1. Git. Git is used in development of the application and is very useful when getting new updates
1. A good text editor which supports INI files. Things such as Notepad++ and VSCode are preferable.

### To develop an extension, theme or contribute; you must have

1. Git. As mentioned before, but more importantly this time. Git is essential to push and synchronize changes.
1. A good text editor which supports PHP, HTML, CSS, JS, JSON (among others). If you don't know what do go for, either Atom or VSCode are recommended.
1. The SDK that comes with the repository. This is essential for creating all kinds of work for the site. You will be able to create a theme without them, but it will be significantly more difficult and may even lead to errors.
1. Python 3.5 or later. This is used to configure the project and is important. Once again, you can survive without it, but it may lead to errors.
