Scambaiting is one of the few things which you can do to fight fraud and have fun at the same time. Being imaginative and pretending to be other characters can be hugely entertaining. And, while having fun doing this, you are also doing the world a favor by preventing fraudsters from taking advantage of real victims.

So, I think it's important to make this pastime as safe and easy as possible.

The DSJAS project provides numerous tools and utilities for scambaiters which make the experience better in many ways. For example, our flagship project - which happens to give the name - is a piece of software which mimics a banking website for scammers attempting to steal banking credentials. We have tools for blocking syskey attacks and making notepad difficult to use (many scammers use notepad on the computer to get the victim to write out payment info).

All of our tools are available free of charge and licensed under either a free software or common open source licence. Anybody can use them, for any purpose and without any payment.

## Our projects

> Right now, the majority of our projects are either in beta or not yet released. This is mostly due to the fact that the project only started recently and is still under heavy development work
