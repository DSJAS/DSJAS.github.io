# About the DSJAS project

The DSJAS project was started in early 2019 by me, Ethan Marshall. My GitHub homepage is located at <https://github.com/OverEngineeredCode>. At the time, for whatever reason, I was experiencing quite a large volume of telemarketer calls and, especially, automated calls attempting to convince me that I had a problem on my computer, was owed a refund etc.

This started to get kind of annoying, so I decided to do something about it. The project started out with me creating a fake banking website which was designed to solve some of the shortcomings that existing fake banking solutions had at the time. The core idea of the site started off that the appearance and behavior of the site should be ultimately customizable and that the site should be ultimately designed around extendability.

After quite a bit of development and road testing, the projects are finally almost ready for release and production use.

So, I started this project as an aggregation of all the tools I have developed and to discuss with users and collaborators.

## About me

My name is Ethan and I am the lead developer of the project. I write all tools from scratch and come up with the majority of ideas on my own. Some of the ideas in the projects featured are inspired by other people's projects of suggested by people I know.
